**Welcome!**
I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, focusing on expanding my expertise in GPU applications, particularly for machine learning and beyond.

Before moving to Atlanta, I worked as a software engineer at [Samsung Electronics Device Solutions](https://www.samsung.com/us/about-us/our-business/device-solutions/), where I contributed to the development of RDNA-based Xclipse GPUs for [Exynos SoCs](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/mobile-processor/exynos-2400/). I was also involved in mobile GPU performance optimization at Samsung's research lab, [SARC-ACL](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/about-us/us-office/us-r-and-d-labs/computing-lab-sarc-acl/), in San Jose, CA, and participated in marketing efforts for [CES 2024](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/events/ces-2024/) (catch me at 1:15 in the video!). Prior to my time at Samsung, I earned dual Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Sogang University](https://www.sogang.ac.kr/), graduating with Magna Cum Laude honors.
